# Cefalo - Python Assignment


**I have completed total 3 phases. There are two python files and one requirements.txt files in the assignment. They are:**
```sh
a. application.py - Used for scrapping, storing and serving datas.
```
```sh
b. test.py - For several unittests to check if they are working accordingly.
```
```sh
b. requirements.txt - Necessary dependencies/libraries that I have used to complete the task.
```

```sh
I have chosen TinyDB as my database. It's a portable and light db that stores data in json file.
```



## Instructions to follow:


- Open console and create a virtual environment for installing necessary dependencies from requirements.txt.


- For Scrapping and Storing datas in TinyDB used the command given below.
    ```sh
    python application.py parse
    ```
    Please wait till all the datas are scrapped and stored in the DB properly. It make take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

- For Serving Datas in the server use:

    ```sh
    python application.py serve
    ```


- For checking test cases, run:
    ```sh
    python test.py
    ```


### API data
- After server is started, navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" and all the movie list data will be visible there in JSON format.
- You can also navigate to movie details data using the id in the end of the url like: "http://127.0.0.1:5000/23"

### 5. Using Postman
- You can fetch data by using postman from API endpoints. Just use it accordingly and enjoy.
